                      Education has many advantages for people. For instance, it illuminates a person’s mind and thinking. 
                      It helps students to plan for work or pursue a higher education while graduating from university.
                       Having education in an area helps people think, feel, and behave in a way that contributes to their success, and improves not only their personal satisfaction but also their community.
                        In addition, education develops human personality, thoughts, dealing with others and prepares people for life experiences.
                         It makes people have a special status in their own society and everywhere they live in. 
                         I believe that everyone is entitled to have education from cradle to grave.
                          There are various benefits of having education such as having a good career, having a good status in society, and having self-confidence.

                             Moreover, education polishes our mind, reinforces our thoughts, and strengthens our character and behaviors toward others. It equips us with information in various fields in general and our specialization in particular; especially what we need to master in our job career.
                              Therefore, without education we may not survive properly nor have a decent profession. </p>

                                <p>The education grants us a good status in society. As educated people, we are considered as a valuable source of knowledge for our society.
                                     Having education helps us teach others morals, manners and ethics in our society. For this reason, people deal with us in a considerable and special way for being productive and resourceful. 
                                     In addition, education makes us a role model in society when our people need us to guide them to the right way or when they want to take a decision. Thus, it is an honor for us to serve our community and contribute towards its advancement. 
                                     In fact, being educated is an advantage to help our people and build a good society. Besides, it is very well-known that having self-confidence is always generated from education.
                                      It is a great blessing for us to have self-confidence which leads to many advantages and success in life. 
                                      For example, it helps us manage specific tasks, tackle life’s challenges and maintain positive stands. Additionally, having self-confidence is typically based on proper education; paving the path for us to success. 
                                      Accordingly, self-confidence makes us aware of how well we perform a task or a range of actions. In short, being educated is undoubtedly being self-confident and successful in life.
                                       All in all, education is the process of acquiring knowledge and information that lead to a successful future.
